# Petitjean Index Calculator

A Python implementation for calculating the **Petitjean Index**, a topological descriptor widely used in cheminformatics to characterize molecular shape.  

This project was developed as part of a coding assignment.

## ðŸ“– What is the Petitjean Index?
The **Petitjean Index (I)** is defined as:
I = (D - R) / R

Where:
- **D** = graph diameter (longest shortest path in the molecular graph)  
- **R** = graph radius (minimum eccentricity among all vertices)  

It quantifies the ratio of molecular spread by comparing maximum and minimum distances in a graph.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Parses molecular structures from `.mol` and '.sdf' files  
- Constructs molecular graphs using **NetworkX**  
- Computes:
  - Shortest paths  
  - Node eccentricities  
  - Graph radius & diameter  
- Calculates the **Petitjean Index**
